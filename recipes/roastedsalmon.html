    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lemon, garlic and parsley are infused in this salmon while it bakes in your oven in only 10 minutes. All on One Pan Lemon Garlic Baked Salmon + Asparagus is the best and easiest way to get salmon on your dinner table!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 - 6 (6 oz or 170 g) salmon fillets, skin removed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley</li>
            <li>1/3 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Kosher salt (or sea salt flakes)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper</li>
            <li>4 bunches asparagus (24 spears), woody ends removed</li>
            <li>1 lemon , sliced to garnish</li>
            <li>1/3 cup beans/peas or any other greens</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <strong>Step 1</strong>
            <p>Preheat oven broiler (or grill) to high heat. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Arrange oven shelf to the second top shelf (about 8-inches from the heat element).</p>
        <strong>Step 2</strong>
            <p>Place the salmon on a large baking tray. Rub each fillet evenly with the garlic and parsley to evenly coat; pour over the lemon juice. Spray with a light coating of olive oil spray and season with salt and pepper. Arrange the asparagus and greens around the salmon in a single layer, and place the lemon slices over the top.</p>
        <strong>Step 3</strong>
            <p>Broil (or grill) for 8-10 minutes, or until salmon is cooked through to your liking (we find 8 minutes is perfect if the oven is hot).</p>
        <strong>Step 4</strong>
            <p>Serve with the asparagus and beans/peas and crispy smashed potatoes!</p>
